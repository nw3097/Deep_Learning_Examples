# Deep_Learning_Examples
LSTM: visualize what hidden neurons are doing in LSTM through an example of counting.<br><br>
MNIST_tensorflow: work through an MNIST tensorflow tutorial, covering softmax regression, tensorboard, save checkpoints, restore models, and CNN, adding one thing at a time.<br><br>
RBM: understand how Hopfield net works; Python implementation of the MATLAB code in <i> Reducing the Dimensionality of Data with Neural Networks </i> (Hinton and Salakhutdinov 2006) (only the stacked RBM part, not the backprop fine tuning part).<br><br>
Reddit: apply topic modeling to about 38,000 legaladvice subreddit posts, visualize topics<br><br>
CNN: understand what filters do in CNN through an edge detection example
